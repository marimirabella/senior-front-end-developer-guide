## Functional programming

<br />

It is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**.

<br />

### Pros/Cons

### Core concepts

- **Pure function** - given the same input, always returns the same output. Has no side-effects.
- **Avoid side effects**. A side effect is any application state change that is observable outside the called function other than its return value.

  Side effects include:

  <IconList>
    Modifying any external variable or object property (e.g., a global variable,
    or a variable in the parent function scope chain)
    <br />
    Logging to the console
    <br />
    Writing to the screen
    <br />
    Writing to a file
    <br />
    Writing to the network
    <br />
    Triggering any external process - Calling any other functions with
    side-effects
  </IconList>

- **Avoid mutating state**. An **immutable** object is an object that can't be modified after it's created. Conversely, a **mutable** object is any object which can be modified after it's created. Which leads to garbage collector and memory issues. If the object is mutable the result is unexpected because it can be mutated not in the right moment.
- **Avoid shared state**. **Shared state** is any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes. A shared scope can include global scope or closure scopes. Often, in object oriented programming, objects are shared between scopes by adding properties to other objects. Functional programming avoids shared state â€” instead relying on immutable data structures and pure calculations to derive new data from existing data.
- **Function composition** - is the process of combining two or more functions in order to produce a new function or perform some computation (like compose/pipe, chaining). Applying one function to the result of another. Building the new function from old function by passing arguments.

  All software development is composition: The act of breaking a complex problem down to smaller parts, and then composing those smaller solutions together to form your application.

### Other concepts of Functional Programming

- **High order function** - is any function which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both.

  Examples: `redux`, `Array`, `map/filter/reduce` array methods, `HOC`, `closure`, `currying`, `EventListener`.

- **Functions as first-class entities/functions/citizen** - meaning that functions are first-class objects when functions are treated like any other variable.

  They can:

  <IconList>
    Be stored in a variable
    <br />
    Be passed as arguments to functions
    <br />
    Be returned by functions
    <br />
    Be stored in some data structure
    <br />
    Hold their own properties and methods
  </IconList>

- **Currying** - A function returning another function that might return another function, but every returned function must take only one parameter at a time. Use cases: memoization, validation. Can be used to create a first-class function (uses fn as arg).
  ```js
  const curry = (a) => (b) => a * b;
  ```
- **Partial Application** - A function returning another function that might return another function, but each returned function can take several parameters. Use cases: `ramda` has `partial` function, `bind`.
  ```js
  const partialApplication = (a, b) => (c, d) => a * b * c * d;
  ```
- **Recursion** means a function calls repeatedly. It is a **process of calling itself**. Function which has its name in its declaration is a recursive function.

  #### Pros

  <IconList iconType="plus" mb={1}>
    Can reduce time complexity. Memoization of the result (aka save the value of
    each calculation for further use in the recursive call) can reduce time
    complexity. For instance, Fibonacci is better with recursion instead of
    iteration.
    <br />
    Adds clarity and reduces the time needed to write and debug code when the
    input is small.
    <br />
    Is the best for a tree traversal. One of the more efficient ways to traverse
    these trees when looking for a specific leaf (or node) is by recursively
    following a single branch until the end of that branch until you find the
    value you are looking for.
  </IconList>

  #### Cons

  <IconList iconType="minus">
    It is usually slower due to the overhead of maintaining the stack. The
    reason is that it requires the allocation of a new stack frame.
    <br />
    It usually uses more memory for the stack because the function has to add to
    the stack with each recursive call and keep the values there until the call
    is finished, the memory allocation is greater than that of an iterative
    function.

- **Memorization** - optimization technique of storing previously executed computations.

      Is an optimization technique that speeds up applications by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

  In JS hash of table is used for storing objects. To save and cache the result and return it instead of computation.

      _When to use_: heavy computing functions, remote API calls (save you from making repetitive calls to the server), recursive function (save the value of each calculation for further use).

      ##### 2 main concepts:

  <IconList iconType="minus">
    **Closure** - function wrapped together (enclosed) with references to the
    corresponding state (the lexical environment). Allows you access to the
    domain of the outer function from the inner function
    <br />
    **Higher-order function** - a high order function accepts another function
    as an argument or returns a function as its output.
  </IconList>

  ##### Example

  ```js
  // function that takes a function and returns a function
  const memoize = (func) => {
    // a cache of results
    const results = {};
    // return a function for the cache of results
    return (...args) => {
      // a JSON key to save the results cache
      const argsKey = JSON.stringify(args);
      // execute `func` only if there is no cached value of clumsysquare()
      if (!results[argsKey]) {
        // store the return value of clumsysquare()
        results[argsKey] = func(...args);
      }
      // return the cached results
      return results[argsKey];
    };
  };
  ```
